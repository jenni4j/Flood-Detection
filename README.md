# Flood-Detection

## Identifying Flood Water Using Deep Learning Algorithms Trained on Satellite Data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Satellites (Graduate Project for CS 7643 @ Georgia Tech)

Flooding has historically been one of the worst natural disasters, both in terms of monetary damage and lives claimed. While modern advances in infrastructure and disaster response have resulted in less deadly flood events, flood risk itself is expected to increase. Accurate flood mapping being critical to aiding in search and rescue efforts, there is a great demonstrable need for automated flood water identification techniques that can rely on quickly available satellite data. In this project, we implement various fully convolutional network architectures from scratch and train them to create segmentation maps of flooded areas using a curated flood water dataset. We also replace the segmentation head of a vision transformer pre-trained on other satellite data and resume training on our flood water dataset.
