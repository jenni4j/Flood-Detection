### Identifying Flood Water Using Deep Learning Algorithms Trained on Satellite Data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Satellites
#### Graduate Project for CS 7643 @ Georgia Tech

Flooding has historically been one of the worst natural disasters, both in terms of monetary damage and lives claimed. 
While modern advances in infrastructure and disaster response have resulted in less deadly flood events, flood risk itself is expected to increase. 
Accurate flood mapping being critical to aiding in search and rescue efforts, there is a great demonstrable need for automated flood water identification techniques that can rely on quickly available satellite data. 

In this project, various fully convolutional network architectures were implemented from scratch and trained to create segmentation maps of flooded areas using a curated flood water dataset. A vision transformer pretrained on generic satellite data was also used in order to compare & improve base performance.
